## Word analysis

In this section we look at the words each author uses to distinguish some common phrases that may differentiate them.

In the first figure, we look at individual words by themselves, with no context.

We see that  "time", "life", "night" and "eyes" are common to the 3 authors. MWS uses "love" a lot, and HPL uses "strange".
